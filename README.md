# Dota 2 Stats

- View a list of teams on the pro circuit
- View a individual teams roster and recent matches
- View the details of an individual match
- View an individual players profile

I am using mock data from the [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com/), instead of making live requests to the free API. Therefore, you should expect to see the same mock data once you have clicked into a team(_The teams players and match data will most likely not reflect the actual team you selected_). In the future I will hook up live requests and integrate it into Redux/Redux Saga.

# Dota 2 Pro Circuit Demo

[View Demo]()

This basic demo is a work in progress, but hopefully showcases my understanding of React, GraphQL, TypeScript, & JavaScript in general. You should be able to do the following from the index page:

- View a list of teams on the pro circuit
- View a individual teams roster and recent matches
- View the details of an individual match
- View an individual players profile (Coming soon)

I am using mock data from the [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com/), instead of making live requests to the free API. Therefore, you should expect to see the same mock data once you have clicked into a team(The teams players and match data will most likely not reflect the actual team you selected). In the future I will hook up live requests and integrate it into Redux/Redux Saga.

## Design

I know it's not the prettiest thing to look at, but design is not my specialty. I did my best to come up with a neat and organized layout that should be easy to navigate.
